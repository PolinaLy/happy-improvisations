                        This scroll records a journey down the Yodo River from Kyoto to Osaka made in the spring of 1767 by Jakuchū, one of the Edo period’s most inventive artists, and his mentor Daiten Kenjō (1719–1801), a Zen monk. In Daiten’s impromptu poems and Jakuchū’s sketches, the two friends capture the scenery of the Kyoto region. Jakuchū transformed his drawings into woodblock prints using a technique that mimicked the appearance of Chinese ink rubbings taken from stone slabs.
